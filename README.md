# GettingAndCleaningData

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. And the
goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit,
Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data collected
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
